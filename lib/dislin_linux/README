1.) Introduction

   DISLIN is a high level and easy to use graphics library for displaying
   data as curves,  bar graphs,  pie charts,  3D-colour plots,  surfaces,
   contours and maps. The software is available for several C, Fortran 77
   and Fortran 90 compilers.

   The UNIX versions of the graphics software  DISLIN  are distributed as 
   compressed tar files with the file names 'dislin-n.m.xxx.tar.gz' where
   'n.m' contains the DISLIN version while the part 'xxx'  identifies the 
   operating system or compiler.  

   Note:  This distribution of DISLIN supports programming on Linux 64-bit
          with gcc, g77, g95, GFortran, Portland pgf77/pgf90, Intel icc/
          ifort, Perl and Python. The distribution is created on a OpenSuse 
          11.5 system.
          A Motif runtime library (libXm.so.4) is necessary for using the
          DISLIN libraries. If your  Linux  distribution does not contain
          OpenMotif, corresponding RPM packages can be downloaded from the
          site www.openmotif.org, or from ftp://ftp.ics.com/openmotif.


2.) Installing the RPM distribution of DISLIN

   The installtion of the RPM distribution of DISLIN for Linux is
   very easy. Give the command

                  rpm -i  dislin-11.5.linux.i586_64.rpm

   This installs DISLIN in the directory '/usr/local/dislin'. The DISLIN
   utilities are copied to '/usr/local/bin' and links to the DISLIN 
   libraries are created in '/usr/lib' and '/usr/lib64'.

   To uninstall DISLIN give the command:

                  rpm -e  dislin 

   Notes:  -  You must be root to install the RPM distribution of DISLIN.

           -  It's not necessary to define the environment variable
              DISLIN, or to change the PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
              environments for the RPM distribution of DISLIN.


3.) Installation of the DEB Distribution of DISLIN

   deb is the native package format for Debian and Ubuntu systems. deb 
   packages can be installed with the dpkg command. Give the command:

          dpkg  -i  dislin-11.5.linux.i586_64.deb (or sudo dpkg on Ubuntu)

   
   To uninstall DISLIN give the command

          dpkg -r   dislin                      (or sudo dpkg on Ubuntu)

   Notes:  - You must be root to install the DISLIN deb distribution.  

           - DISLIN will be installed in the directory /usr/local/dislin. 
             Binaries will be copied to /usr/local/bin and links to the 
             DISLIN libraries will be created in /usr/lib and /usr/lib64.


4.) Installation of the tar.gz Distribution

a) Uncompress the tar.gz file with the command

                  gzip -d     dislin-11.5.linux.i586_64.tar.gz


b) Restore files from the tar file with the command

                  tar   xvf   dislin-11.5.linux.i586_64.tar    

c) Change to the extraction directory of DISLIN

                  cd    dislin-11.5

d) Choose a directory in the file structure where DISLIN should be
   installed and define the environment variable DISLIN with it:

   For example:    DISLIN=$HOME/dislin     (or: /usr/local/dislin)
                   export DISLIN
    
e) Run the install program with the command 

                   INSTALL

   This program copies files to $DISLIN and sets protections.

f) To make DISLIN available for general use, write the following com-
   mands to your .profile or to /etc/profile

                    DISLIN=directory                     
                    export DISLIN
                    PATH=${PATH}:${DISLIN}/bin

                    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DISLIN:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
                    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

   Note: The environment variable DISLIN is not necessary if DISLIN
         is installed in the default directory '/usr/local/dislin'. 


5.) Compiling, Linking and Running the Example Programs

   Now you can compile, link and run the example programs in the
   directory $DISLIN/examples with the commands:

                    clink     -a exa_c      (for gcc)       
                    cpplink   -a exa_cpp    (for g++)       
                    iclink    -a exa_c      (for Intel icc)
                    sclink    -a exa_c      (Sun Studio cc)
       
                    dlink     -a exa_f77    (for g77)
                    gf77link  -a exa_f77    (for gfortran)
                    if77link  -a exa_f77    (for Intel ifort)
                    af77link  -a exa_f77    (for Absoft f77)
                    pgf77link -a exa_f77    (for Portland pgf77)
                    sf77link  -a exa_f77    (for Sun Stdudio f77)

                    f90link   -a exa_f90    (for g95)
                    gf95link  -a exa_f90    (for GFortran)
                    if90link  -a exa_f90    (for Intel ifort)
                    af90link  -a exa_f90    (for Absoft f90)
                    pgf90link -a exa_f90    (for Portland pgf90)
                    sf90link  -a exa_f90    (for Sun Stdudio f90)

   Analog the examples map_c.c, map_cpp.cpp, map_f77.f and map_f90.f90. 

   Notes: - The utilities above link by default with the DISLIN single 
            precision library libdislin.so. A double precision version
            of the library for real numbers with the name libdislin_d.so
            is included in this distribution. The Dislin library for C++
            is only implemented as a double precision library.

          - This distribution contains pre-compiled DISLIN module files
            for Fortran 90/95 compilers. If your compiler version does not 
            recognize the module format, you have to recompile the file
            'dislin.f90' in one of the directories $DISLIN/g95 (for g95),
            $DISLIN/gf (for gfortran), $DISLIN/ifc (for Intel ifort),
            $DISLIN/af (for Absoft f90), $DISLIN/pgf (for Portland pgf90)
            or $DISLIN/sun for Sun Studio f90 with your compiler version.
            For Absoft f90 the options -YEXT_NAMES=LCS and -YEXT_SFX=_
            should be used for compiling.

h) You can delete the directory 'dislin-11.5'.


6.) Using DISLIN from Perl        

   A DISLIN module for the programming language Perl is included in this
   DISLIN distribution. The module and some examples can be found in the
   directory $DISLIN/perl

   To use DISLIN from Perl, you have to define the  environment variable
   PERL5LIB:

             export PERL5LIB=$DISLIN/perl

   Note: The Perl module was created with Perl version 5.30.0, but
         pre-compiled modules for Perl 5.22.1, Perl 5.26.1 and Perl
         5.32.1 are also included. Source code of the module is contained
         in the directory $DISLIN/perl for re-creating the module if your
         Perl version is not compatible with the versions above.


7.) Using DISLIN from Python        

   An extension module for the programming language Python is also 
   included in  DISLIN for Linux. The module and examples can be found
   in the directory $DISLIN/python ($DISIN/python3 for Python3).

   To use DISLIN from Python, you have to define the  environment variable
   PYTHONPATH:

             export PYTHONPATH=$DISLIN/python

   Note: Source code of the Python extension is included in $DISLIN/python
         for re-creating the module. 


8.) Using DISLIN from Java        

   An interface for the programming language Java is also included in
   the DISLIN distribution for Linux. It allows to use DISLIN routines
   from Java applications. The interface and examples can be found in 
   the directory $DISLIN/java

   To use DISLIN from Java, you have to define the  environment variable
   CLASSPATH:

             export CLASSPATH=$DISLIN/java/dislin.jar:.
   
   The examples in $DISLIN/java can be compiled and executed with the
   commands

   javac  example.java
   java   example 

   Note:  The shareable library disjava-11.5.so in the directory $DISLIN/java
          was created with Java version JSDK 1.5.0.


9.) Using DISLIN from Ruby  

   A pre-compiled extension module for the programming language Ruby is
   included in DISLIN for Linux. The module and examples can be found
   in the directory $DISLIN/ruby.

   To use DISLIN from Ruby, you have to define the  environment variable
   RUBYLIB:

             export RUBYLIB=$DISLIN/ruby

   The examples in $DISLIN/ruby can be executed with the command:

   ./curve.rb
   ...

   Note: Source code of the Ruby extension is included in $DISLIN/ruby
         for re-creating the module.


10.) Using DISLIN from Julia  

   To use DISLIN from Julia, you have to define the  environment variable
   JULIA_LOAD_PATH:

             export JULIA_LOAD_PATH=$DISLIN/julia

   The examples in $DISLIN/julia can be executed with the command:

   julia curve.jl
   ...


11.) Using DISLIN from Go  

   To use DISLIN from Go, you have to define the environment variable
   GOPATH:

             export GOPATH=$DISLIN/go

   The Go interface to DISLIN can be compiled with the command:

   cd $GOPATH/src/dislin
   go build               

   Note: If DISLIN is not installed in the directory /usr/local/dislin,
         you have to define the environment variable CGO_LDFLAGS.
         For example:  export CGO_LDFLAGS=-L$DISLIN
         Otherwise, go build will not find the DISLIN library.

   After that you can compile and run the DISLIN examples for Go:

   cd $GOPATH/src
   go build curve.go
   ./curve

   ......


12.) Using DISLIN from Tcl  

   A pre-compiled extension module for is also included in DISLIN for
   Linux. The module and examples can be found in the directory
   $DISLIN/tcl.

   To use DISLIN from Tcl, you have to add the directory $DISLIN/tcl
   to the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH

             LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DISLIN/tcl:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
             export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

   The examples in $DISLIN/tcl can be executed with the command:

   tclsh curve.tcl
   ...

   Note: Source code of the Tcl extension is included in $DISLIN/tcl
         for re-creating the module.


13.) Using DISLIN with the C/C++ Interpreter Ch 

   This distribution of Dislin contains a pre-compiled interface for the
   C/C++ interpreter Ch. For running the Ch examples of Dislin, you can 
   change to the $DISLIN/examples/ch directory and give the commands:

   ch curve.ch
   ch bars.ch
   ....

   Notes: 

     - The directoy $DISLIN/examples/ch contains the header file 'dislin.h'
       which is used by the .ch examples. The file 'dislin.h' contains two
       pragma statements for setting the _fpath and _lpath system variables
       with the DISLIN installation directory. If you have not installed
       DISLIN in the default directory /usr/local/dislin, you have to change
       the pragma statements corresponding to your DISLIN installation.

     - The shareable library dislin.dl for Ch is based on the double 
       precision C library of DISLIN. 
       

14.) Getting DISLIN Support

   The DISLIN distributions can be used freely without any restriction.
   Access to the source code is availabe via a support contract from the
   site www.dislin.de.
